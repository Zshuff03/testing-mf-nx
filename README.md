# testing-mf-nx
 A repo to test module federation with angular. The current setup is that there are 2 nx workspaces, a shell and a remote, containing both a shell app and a remote app respectively. This is to simulate using the module federation in 2 separate nx repos, and dynamic federation to link the two together.

This was generated using the nx docs [here.] (https://nx.dev/recipes/module-federation/dynamic-module-federation-with-angular)
